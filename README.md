This project was created using pipenv (https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) for Python

## Python Webscraper

A basic webscraper built with Python that extracts the text quotes from http://quotes.toscrape.com/

This code can be modified to scrape different types of data from any website with some HTML knowledge.

The program can be run without installing pipenv using the Webscraper executable in the dist folder.

## TODO

- Modify code to scrape from a database
- Automate cleaning and saving scraped data locally
- Create UI for usage without terminal
